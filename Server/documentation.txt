3. Endpoint for web interface

/api/subscribers
GET

returns 
[
    {
        plate_number: "34-534L-34"
        status: true/false,    (indicates if car is paid or unpaid)
        packing_space_id: 4233, 
        message: "upaid"/"paid"/"expired"
    },

4. Endpoint for admin
-  sets expiration duration 
/api/admin/ticket-duration
PUT
{
    ticket-duration: 24:00:00
}

returns 
STATUS 200 OK if successful.

Explanation:

When an employee records a paid user(car owner), the current time is designated as start time and status is 
true. If a car is detected by the robot and it's status is false, it does not exist in records or presence exceeds ticket duration (reset),  
the car is said to be unpaid thus this is recorded  or updated in database with a default start time of zero and a false status.
